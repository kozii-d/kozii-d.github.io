    <p>
        Welcome to HoverTranslate! We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data.
        This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) explains what data we collect, how we use it, and the measures we take to
        protect it. This Policy applies to all users of the <strong>HoverTranslate</strong> extension (“Extension”).
    </p>

    <h2>1. Data Collection and Use</h2>
    <h3>1.1 Google Authentication Data (OAuth)</h3>
    <p>
        When you use the Google sign-in (OAuth) functionality, our Extension requests and receives the following data:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>User ID (sub)</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Email (email)</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Email verification status (email_verified)</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Name (name)</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Given name (given_name)</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Family name (family_name)</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Profile picture URL (picture)</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        We need this data to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify you and enable you to sign in to the Extension.</li>
        <li>Create and maintain your user account in our database.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.2 Dictionary and Translation Data</h3>
    <p>
        The Extension provides a personal dictionary feature for saving unfamiliar words or phrases from subtitles.
        <strong>However, we do not store these words or phrases on our servers.</strong> The saved dictionary items are
        stored locally in your browser’s <em>Chrome storage</em>. We do not have remote access to these items and do not
        use them for any purpose other than providing you with the personal dictionary functionality.
    </p>

    <h3>1.3 Automatically Collected Data</h3>
    <p>
        We do not collect automatic activity logs, browsing history, or other data that would allow us to track your
        internet behavior. If we decide in the future to collect such information, we will request your explicit consent
        and update this Policy accordingly.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Data Sharing with Third Parties</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>We do not sell</strong> or transfer your personal data to third parties.</li>
        <li>
            Data may be shared only as required by law (e.g., in response to a court order or law enforcement request).
        </li>
        <li>
            We may use third-party service providers (e.g., hosting or cloud storage) to operate the service.
            Such providers must comply with security and confidentiality standards that are at least as strict as ours.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Retention Period:</strong> We store your data (Google ID, email, etc.) in our database
        as long as it is necessary for the proper functioning of the Extension.
        You may request deletion of your account at any time.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Security:</strong> We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your data
        against unauthorized access, loss, or alteration. Access to our database is restricted and protected by
        authentication, and all network connections may use encryption (HTTPS or another secure protocol).
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Data Breach or Leakage:</strong> If we become aware of any unauthorized access to your personal data,
        we will promptly notify you and take all necessary steps to minimize the damage and prevent similar incidents
        in the future.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Use of Translation and Subtitle Data</h2>
    <p>
        HoverTranslate processes subtitles locally and may use a third-party translation API (e.g., Google Translate API)
        only for translating selected words or phrases. We do not store subtitle content on our server and do not track
        your activity while watching videos.
    </p>

    <h2>5. User Rights</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Access to Data:</strong> You may request information about what personal data we hold about you.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Data Correction:</strong> If your data is incorrect or out of date, you can make corrections or
            contact us to update it.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Data Deletion:</strong> You may request the deletion of your account, and we will remove all
            related data (except in cases where we are legally required to retain it).
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Withdrawal of Consent:</strong> If you disagree with this Policy or any updates to it, you may
            withdraw your consent by discontinuing use of the Extension and requesting account deletion.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Cookies and Similar Technologies</h2>
    <p>
        Currently, the Extension <strong>does not use</strong> cookies for tracking or advertising.
        However, our website may use cookies for basic analytics
        or operational purposes (e.g., GitHub Pages, Google Analytics). In such cases, you will see a relevant
        notification on the website.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        We do not knowingly provide our service to children under 13 years of age or collect personal data from them.
        If you believe your child has provided us with their personal data without parental consent,
        please contact us so we can delete it.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in the Extension’s functionality,
        legal requirements, or our internal processes. If we make significant changes, we will notify you by posting
        the new Policy on our website and/or by sending an email notification (or through the Extension interface).
    </p>

    <h2>9. Contact Information</h2>
